# Lattice_iCEstick_tutorial
This repo is the Lattice iCEcube tutorial written for UNLV Baker's students

If you're reading this, you must be one of the Baker's student who is interested in learning about using Lattice FPGA in the lab!
Well, I tried to write the tutorial as step-by-step as possible.

It will cover from how to install the software development tool to program the Lattice iCEstick board.
